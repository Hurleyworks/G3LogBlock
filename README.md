# G3LogBlock
Cinder Block for Kjell Hedstr√∂m's g3log

https://github.com/KjellKod/g3log

In your own projects just include the g3logger.h and the amalagated g3logger.cpp. Don't include the g3log folder since all the .cpp files within are already included in g3logger.cpp. 

You need to link to the DbgHelp.lib on Windows
